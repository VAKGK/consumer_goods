## 📖 Overview

**Business doesn't always wait for a dashboard.** Sometimes, management needs immediate answers to specific questions.

This project focuses on the **Ad-Hoc Request** domain for **Atliq Hardwares** (a fictional consumer goods company). The goal was to run 10 specific SQL queries to extract critical business insights that are not readily available in standard reports. These insights were then visualized to help management make quick, data-informed decisions.

> *"Turning rapid-fire questions into actionable data answers."*
